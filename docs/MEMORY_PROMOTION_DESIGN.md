# SHORT_TERM to LONG_TERM Memory Promotion Logic Design

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines a sophisticated memory promotion system for upgrading SHORT_TERM memories to LONG_TERM status in the LangGraph + Mem0 AI Agent. The design moves beyond simple access counting to implement a multi-factor scoring system that better reflects human memory psychology.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### Current System Limitations
The existing promotion logic uses basic thresholds:
- Access count ≥ 7
- Importance ≥ 5.0  
- Reinforcement ≥ 3
- Age ≥ 24 hours

### New Approach: Multi-Factor Intelligence
Instead of simple counting, evaluate memories across four key dimensions:
1. **Access Patterns** - How and when the memory is used
2. **Content Stability** - How consistent the information remains over time
3. **User Engagement** - How actively the user interacts with the information
4. **Semantic Importance** - How personally relevant the content is

## 📊 Composite Scoring System

### Score Calculation Formula
```
Promotion Score = (Access Pattern × 30%) + (Content Stability × 25%) + 
                  (User Engagement × 25%) + (Semantic Importance × 20%)
```

### Promotion Threshold
- **Standard Promotion**: Composite score ≥ 7.0/10
- **Minimum Requirements**: Age ≥ 6 hours, Access count ≥ 3, No recent contradictions

## 🔍 Detailed Scoring Components

### 1. Access Pattern Score (0-10) - Weight: 30%

**Purpose**: Evaluate how frequently and consistently the memory is accessed.

**Calculation Logic**:
```python
base_score = min(access_count * 1.5, 6.0)  # Diminishing returns after 4 accesses
time_distribution_bonus = calculate_time_spread_bonus()  # +0-2 points
cross_session_bonus = unique_sessions * 0.5  # +0-2 points
total = min(base_score + bonuses, 10.0)
```

**Factors Considered**:
- **Raw Access Count**: More accesses = higher score (with diminishing returns)
- **Time Distribution**: Accesses spread over time > clustered accesses
- **Cross-Session Usage**: Memory accessed across multiple conversation sessions
- **Access Recency**: Recent accesses weighted more heavily

**Examples**:
- Memory accessed 5 times in 1 hour: Lower score (clustered)
- Memory accessed 4 times over 3 days: Higher score (distributed)
- Memory accessed in 3 different conversation sessions: Bonus points

### 2. Content Stability Score (0-10) - Weight: 25%

**Purpose**: Measure how stable and consistent the memory content remains over time.

**Calculation Logic**:
```python
age_stability = min(age_hours / 24, 3.0)  # More stable over time, max 3 points
contradiction_penalty = contradiction_count * -2.0  # -2 per contradiction
reinforcement_bonus = reinforcement_count * 1.0  # +1 per reinforcement
consistency_bonus = check_consistency_with_other_memories()  # +0-2 points
total = max(age_stability + reinforcement_bonus + consistency_bonus + contradiction_penalty, 0)
```

**Factors Considered**:
- **Age Stability**: Older memories that haven't been contradicted are more stable
- **Contradiction Penalty**: Heavy penalty for contradicted information
- **Reinforcement Bonus**: User confirmations increase stability
- **Consistency Check**: How well the memory aligns with other stored memories
- **Last Contradiction Time**: Recent contradictions block promotion

**Examples**:
- Memory unchanged for 48 hours: High stability score
- Memory contradicted twice: Heavy penalty applied
- Memory reinforced by user 3 times: Significant bonus

### 3. User Engagement Score (0-10) - Weight: 25%

**Purpose**: Assess how actively and meaningfully the user engages with the memory.

**Calculation Logic**:
```python
explicit_confirmation = user_confirmations * 2.0  # +2 per confirmation
user_initiated = user_initiated_mentions * 1.5  # +1.5 per user mention
correction_bonus = user_corrections * 3.0  # +3 per correction (very important)
emotional_weight = detect_emotional_content() * 1.0  # +0-2 based on emotion
total = min(sum_of_factors, 10.0)
```

**Factors Considered**:
- **Explicit Confirmations**: User says "yes, that's right" or similar
- **User-Initiated Mentions**: User brings up the topic unprompted
- **Corrections**: User corrects or refines the information (high value)
- **Emotional Content**: Emotional language indicates personal significance
- **Context Relevance**: How often the memory is relevant to current discussions

**Examples**:
- User corrects AI about their preference: +3 points
- User confirms information: +2 points
- User mentions topic unprompted: +1.5 points
- Emotional language detected: +0-2 points

### 4. Semantic Importance Score (0-10) - Weight: 20%

**Purpose**: Evaluate the inherent personal importance of the memory content.

**Calculation Logic**:
```python
personal_pronouns = count_personal_markers() * 0.5  # "I", "my", "me"
preference_indicators = detect_preference_language() * 2.0  # "I like", "I prefer"
identity_markers = detect_identity_content() * 2.5  # "I am", "my name"
factual_content = detect_factual_statements() * 1.5  # Objective facts about user
belief_statements = detect_beliefs() * 2.0  # "I believe", "I think"
total = min(sum_of_factors, 10.0)
```

**Content Analysis Patterns**:

**Identity Markers** (High Value - 2.5x multiplier):
- "My name is...", "I am a...", "I was born..."
- Core identity information

**Preference Indicators** (High Value - 2.0x multiplier):
- "I like...", "I prefer...", "I enjoy...", "I hate..."
- Stable personal preferences

**Belief Statements** (High Value - 2.0x multiplier):
- "I believe...", "I think...", "In my opinion..."
- Personal worldview and opinions

**Factual Content** (Medium Value - 1.5x multiplier):
- Objective facts about the user
- Work information, location, family details

**Personal Pronouns** (Low Value - 0.5x multiplier):
- Basic personal reference indicators
- "I", "my", "me", "mine"

## ⚡ Immediate Promotion Triggers

**Fast-Track Conditions** (Bypass normal scoring):

### 1. User Correction Trigger
- **Condition**: User corrects previous information
- **Rationale**: Corrections indicate high importance and accuracy
- **Example**: "Actually, I prefer tea, not coffee"

### 2. Explicit Importance Trigger
- **Condition**: User explicitly marks information as important
- **Rationale**: Direct user feedback about significance
- **Example**: "That's really important to remember"

### 3. Cross-Session Relevance Trigger
- **Condition**: Memory referenced in 3+ different conversation sessions
- **Rationale**: Persistent relevance across contexts
- **Example**: User's programming language preference mentioned in multiple chats

### 4. High Emotional Content Trigger
- **Condition**: Strong emotional indicators + repeated access
- **Rationale**: Emotional memories are naturally more significant
- **Example**: User discusses personal challenges or achievements

## 🗃️ Enhanced Metadata Structure

### New Tracking Fields
```python
metadata = {
    # Existing fields (preserved)
    "memory_type": "short_term",
    "importance_level": 5.0,
    "access_count": 3,
    "reinforcement_count": 1,
    "created_at": "2025-01-31T10:00:00",
    "last_accessed": "2025-01-31T15:30:00",
    
    # New fields for sophisticated promotion

        "2025-01-31T15:30:00"
    ],
    "promotion_score_history": [
        {"timestamp": "2025-01-31T12:00:00", "score": 5.2},

    }
}
```

## 🔄 Implementation Architecture

### Core Functions Required

#### 1. Main Promotion Logic
```python
def calculate_promotion_score(memory: Dict, user_id: str) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Calculate composite promotion score with breakdown"""
    
def should_promote_to_longterm(memory: Dict, user_id: str) -> Tuple[bool, Dict]:
    """Determine if memory should be promoted with reasoning"""
    
def check_immediate_promotion_triggers(memory: Dict, context: Dict) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """Check for fast-track promotion conditions"""
```

#### 2. Component Scoring Functions
```python
def calculate_access_pattern_score(metadata: Dict) -> float:
    """Analyze access frequency, distribution, and cross-session usage"""
    
def calculate_content_stability_score(metadata: Dict) -> float:
    """Evaluate consistency, contradictions, and reinforcements"""
    
def calculate_user_engagement_score(metadata: Dict, content: str) -> float:
    """Assess user interaction quality and emotional weight"""

## 🛡️ Fallback Strategy

### Graceful Degradation
If sophisticated scoring fails or components are unavailable:

```python
def fallback_promotion_logic(memory: Dict) -> bool:
    """Simple rule-based fallback system"""
    metadata = memory.get('metadata', {})
    
    return (
        metadata.get('access_count', 0) >= 7 and
        metadata.get('importance_level', 0) >= 5.0 and
        metadata.get('reinforcement_count', 0) >= 3 and
        calculate_age_hours(metadata.get('created_at')) >= 24
    )
```

### Error Handling

}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Required
1. **Component Scoring Tests**: Verify each scoring function works correctly
2. **Integration Tests**: Test promotion logic with real memory objects
3. **Edge Case Tests**: Handle malformed data, missing fields, extreme values
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure scoring doesn't impact system performance

### Test Scenarios
1. **Normal Promotion Path**: Memory gradually builds score and gets promoted
2. **Immediate Trigger Path**: Fast-track promotion via user correction
3. **Contradiction Handling**: Memory promotion blocked by contradictions
4. **Fallback Activation**: System degrades gracefully when components fail
5. **Cross-Session Tracking**: Memory accessed across multiple conversations

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Gradual Promotion
```
Day 1: User mentions "I like programming in Python"
- Initial: SHORT_TERM, score: 4.2/10
- Access pattern: 2 accesses, same session
- Semantic importance: High (preference indicator)

Day 2: User references Python preference again
- Updated: score: 6.1/10
- Access pattern: 4 accesses, 2 sessions
- Content stability: No contradictions

Day 3: User confirms "Yes, Python is my favorite"
- Updated: score: 7.8/10 → PROMOTED to LONG_TERM
- User engagement: Explicit confirmation (+2 points)
- Promotion triggered by threshold exceeded
```

### Example 2: Immediate Promotion via Correction
```
User: "Actually, I prefer React over Vue, not the other way around"
- Immediate trigger: User correction detected
- Previous Vue preference: Marked as contradicted
- New React preference: Immediately promoted to LONG_TERM
- Reasoning: User corrections indicate high importance
```

### Example 3: Blocked Promotion
```
Memory: "User likes working late at night"
- Score builds to 6.8/10 over time
- User later says: "I actually prefer morning work now"
- Contradiction detected: Original memory blocked from promotion
- New preference starts fresh promotion cycle
```

2. **Semantic Similarity**: Use embeddings to detect related memories
3. **Temporal Patterns**: Learn user's daily/weekly patterns for better timing
4. **Social Context**: Consider memories shared across multiple users
5. **Importance Prediction**: Predict memory importance before user interaction

### Advanced Features
1. **Memory Networks**: Consider relationships between memories
2. **Contextual Promotion**: Adjust thresholds based on conversation context
3. **User Profiles**: Customize promotion logic per user type
4. **Feedback Loops**: Learn from promotion success/failure rates
